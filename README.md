# Zabbix-Agent-Deployer
Simple and very stupid bash script made in less than 1 hour to prevent me from getting an headache while configuring tons and tons of zabbix agent servers 
It's supposed to get decent in the future, without crappy code, with proxy install support, more configurable, portable and with a better look
